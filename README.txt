Viagogos Coding Challenge - Sam Berkay

Hello! Welcome to my submission for the Viagogo Coding Challenge as part of my grad scheme application.

===================================================

TO RUN ON UNIX
'cd' to '/src' in the working directory
>'javac *.java'
>'java VGCodingChallenge'

TO RUN THROUGH IDE
Open the project folder in any IDE (I use Netbeans)
Press Run!

====================================================

Assumptions made
================
1) Assume ticket prices cap at $100
2) Assume venues have 300 person capacity (and therefore generate up to 300 tickets)
3) Assume any location in the grid has a 50% chance of having an event on

There have been some implementations made to make this scalable to support multiple events, though they are not used.
No attempts have been made to make the world scalable.
